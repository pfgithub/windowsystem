CONCEPT:

Use 4 fake elements to add a 5px or so hidden border around
windows that let you drag them. one top, one left, one bottom
, one right, (maybe 4 more:) top-left, top-right, .... that
way it has custom cursors and stuff

ALSO:

drag below doesn't necessarily need window titles.
just do the bar.
